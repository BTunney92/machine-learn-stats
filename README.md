            Winter 22/23

## Repository 

This repository contains four folders. One each for the three topics and exercises covered during the year and the final Keras project folder.

Topic 1 - Statistics (Lady Tasting Tea, t-Tests)

Topic 2 - Models (Least Square Method, Absolute Value Method, Optimisation)

Topic 3 - Parameters (Using numpy's polyfit to fit polynomials to two data sets)

Code for these is taken from Ian's repository:

## Keras Project

The final folder is the Keras time-series anomaly detection notebook.

The purpose of this project was to re-create the Keras code and explain the concepts and code within.
